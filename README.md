Teaching myself Pytest


- Pytest file should start with "test" as prefix as it uses it as an identifier
- Functions should start with test as prefix
- Pytest runs recursively trying to identify all the files / functions with test as prefix

- Different ways to run pytest
$ python -m pytest
$ pytest -q
$ pytest -v
